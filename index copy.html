  Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James
  Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's fast

  alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters
  Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who
